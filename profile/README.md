Open Source Chandigarh is a dynamic tech community committed to redefining the Open Source and technology ecosystem in Chandigarh, Punjab region and beyond. Established in 2022, the community has grown to over 5,000 members, fostering a strong culture of collaboration, learning and innovation.

We actively operate a sub-community at Chitkara University, Punjab, known as Open Source Chandigarh powered by Chitkara University, where we empower students and tech enthusiasts through engaging and impactful initiatives.

With 50+ events organized to date, including hackathons, hands-on workshops, expert talks, competitions, etc., we’ve created a thriving space for developers and learners alike. We've also built strong relationships through 20+ collaborations with various communities and organizations such as GitHub, Apache, Local Community Indore, Collabnix, Docker Inc., Opstree Solutions and Webiny.

Our mission is to foster open collaboration, support contributors at all levels and build a future-ready tech ecosystem grounded in the values of open source.

Driven by our motto — "Learn. Foster. Express. Because Open Source is Fun." — we strive to create a culture where every voice is valued, curiosity is encouraged and technology becomes a tool for change and innovation.
