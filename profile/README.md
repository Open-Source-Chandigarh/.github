We've also built strong relationships through 20+ collaborations with various communities and organizations such as GitHub, Apache, Local Community Indore, Collabnix, Docker Inc., Opstree Solutions and Webiny.

Our mission is to foster open collaboration, support contributors at all levels and build a future-ready tech ecosystem grounded in the values of open source.
